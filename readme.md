## FAQ

  * ### How do I specify the Windows version?

    You can modify the `VERSION` environment variable to specify the version you want:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      VERSION: "win10x64"
    ```
    
    Select from the values below:
    
    - ~~```win11x64``` (Windows 11)~~
    - ```win10x64``` (Windows 10)
    - ```win81x64``` (Windows 8.1)
    - ```win7x64-ultimate``` (Windows 7 )
    - ```win2016-eval``` (Windows Server 2016)
    - ```win2019-eval``` (Windows Server 2019)
    - ```win2022-eval``` (Windows Server 2022)
    
  * ### How do I see the screen?

    The container includes a web-based viewer, so you can visit [http://localhost:8006/](http://localhost:8006/) using any webbrowser to view the screen and interact with Windows via the keyboard/mouse.

    Alternatively it is also possible to connect to port 5900 using a VNC client like RealVNC or many others.
    
  * ### How do I increase the amount of CPU or RAM?

    By default, a single core and 4 GB of RAM are allocated to the container.

    To increase this, add the following environment variables:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      RAM_SIZE: "8G"
      CPU_CORES: "4"
    ```

  * ### How do I change the size of the data disk?

    To expand the default size of 64 GB, add the `DISK_SIZE` setting to your compose file and set it to your preferred capacity:

    ```yaml
    environment:
      DISK_SIZE: "128G"
    ```
    
    This can also be used to resize the existing disk to a larger capacity without any data loss.
    
  * ### How do I change the location of the data disk?

    To change the location of the data disk, include the following bind mount in your compose file:

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /var/win:/storage
    ```

    Replace the example path `/var/win` with the desired storage folder.

  * ### How do I verify if my system supports KVM?

    To verify if your system supports KVM, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install cpu-checker
    sudo kvm-ok
    ```

    If you receive an error from `kvm-ok` indicating that KVM acceleration can't be used, check the virtualization settings in the BIOS.

  * ### Is this project legal?

    Yes, this project contains only open-source code and does not distribute any copyrighted material. Neither does it try to circumvent any copyright protection measures. So under all applicable laws, this project would be considered legal.
